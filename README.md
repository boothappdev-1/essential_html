## Part One - Essential HTML

 1. Download the ZIP file of this repository to your computer.
 1. Open the whole folder you cloned, `essential_html`, in Sublime.
 1. Read through `details.html`, `index.html`, and `new.html` and try to make sense of them. Open them in Chrome and play with them. Write down any questions you have about anything at all in them.

This is all you **need** to know for now.
